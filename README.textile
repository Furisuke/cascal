Cascal fork with TTL and Secondary indexes
master: Cassandra 0.8.x
branch 0.7: Cassandra 0.7.x

h3. Description:

Cascal is a simple "Cassandra":http://cassandra.apache.org/ library built on the "Scala":www.scala-lang.org language that provides a very consistent and simple means by which you can interact with the Cassandra DB, providing simple means to:

* Insert / List / Get / Delete
* Batch Insert / Delete
* Map Seq[Columns] Into Domain Objects
* Utilize a Session Pool

One of the goals of Cassandra is to make the Thrift library operate in a way more conducive with the Scala language. As such when using Cascal you only need to used the Cascal libraries.

Please see the "wiki pages":http://wiki.github.com/shorrockin/cascal/ for detailed usage information.
